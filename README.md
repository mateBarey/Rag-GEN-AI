# Rag-GEN-AI
Use Dspy and weaviate on local llm llama to create RAG(retrieval augmented generation) content from a query

I this example I use Dolphin 2 model from ollama and implement a Dspy Class with Weaviate in order to
perform rag on the ollama model. My output source file used is the US Tax code.
